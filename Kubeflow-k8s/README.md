# KubeFlow
Be aware that working with kubeflow is hard for those who do not have any understanding of how to work with
kubernetes and have no knowledge of keeping k8s cluster working.
There are many other successful projects working without k8s. 
But if you decide to work with k7s kubeflow. it's a great adventure. A great tool to work with microservices.
- operators: Be aware that you can write your own specific operator to handle the MlOpes. Operators handle ML frameworks 
that are deployed.
