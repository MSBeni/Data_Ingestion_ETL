# In this repository we will focus on the postgres and simple to professional use cases

_ First install postgress on your system using this link: 
https://www.postgresql.org/download/
check the version simply on your linux terminal: 
```bash
$ psql --version
```
- It is always easier to use the docker container to install the postgres and the related GUI which is pgAdmin.
