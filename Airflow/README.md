# Airflow README

## installation
First create a virtual environment and name it whatever you want.
Then activate the environment and run this command on your terminal to install airflow on your system. (I assume you are working on ubuntu which is pretty normal)
```bash
pip3 install apache-airflow==2.0.0 --constraint https://gist.githubusercontent.com/marclamberti/742efaef5b2d94f44666b0aec020be7c/raw/5da51f9fe99266562723fdfb3e11d3b6ac727711/constraint.txt
```
